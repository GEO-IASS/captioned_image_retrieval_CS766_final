# Captioned image retrieval

We explore the task of retrieving similar captioned images from a dataset, given a previously unseen captioned image.

Note: the source code in `SpatialPyramid` has some bugs fixed. It is not exactly the same as the original source code from UIUC.

## To run baseline

1. Add `SpatialPyramid` to path
2. Unzip the Flickr 8k dataset to a `data` subdirectory
3. Run `close all; clear all; baseline;`
