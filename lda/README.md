#Run LDA on dataset (Flickr8k by default)

Steps:
- Run 'compilescripts' in ../topictoolbox once on your system if Linux/MAC
- Run lda.m
- Change parameters in lda.m if required

Results:
- Results of the retrieval are stored in ../data/output.txt (by default)
- If params.toPlot is enabled in lda.m, each tuple of query image-retrieved images is displayed
